MMF2 Extension documentation tool by Chris Branch, 2012
version 0.1

Import an MMF2 extension by clicking the 'Import' button.
The A/C/Es will be read and a tree will be populated corresponding to the menus for each one.

You can edit the text on each page by double-clicking an item.
Create additional pages by right-clicking on the tree where you want it to go;
you can also delete pages this way, too.

When you're done, click Save. A description file will be saved which you can later load for further edits.
In addition, saving will create an HTML Help Workshop project and all the HTML files shall be exported.

You may edit the default text for each parameter by clicking the 'Edit parameters' button.
If you tick the box next to a description, all A/C/Es that use that parameter will have their
individual text reset.

This is beta software; please report bugs to webmaster@lutrasoft.com
